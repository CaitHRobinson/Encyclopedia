## European indicators

**European Energy Poverty Observatory indicators:** [EPOV](https://www.energypoverty.eu/indicators-data) provides a range of different primary and secondary indicators of energy poverty, broken down by country, and according to a range of demographic and socio-economic characteristics. Two of these indicators are based on self-reported experiences of limited access to energy services (based on EU-SILC data): *arrears on utility bills* and *inability to keep the home adequately warm*.
