### Sub-regional fuel poverty indicators

The most established composite indicators of energy poverty that inform national scale policy have originated in England (UK): the ten percent indicator and the Low-Income High Cost (LIHC) indicator. These indicators have also been applied in other national contexts e.g. Poland (Sokolowski et al. 2020) and Southern Europe (Antepara et al. 2020). The ten percent indicator is an absolute measure that recognises households that spent over 10% of their income on energy, as energy poor. This was replaced in 2012 by a LIHC indicator (Hills, 2011), that recognises households as energy poor if their required fuel costs are above average and were they to spend that amount they would be left with an income below the poverty line.
