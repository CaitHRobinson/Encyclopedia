## Mapping fuel poverty indicators for LSOA

**Lower Super Ouput Area boundaries:** The highest resolution at which data are available is Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) representing approximately 1,500 persons (ONS, 2011). A shapefile to map this data can be downloaded from the [UK Data Service](https://borders.ukdataservice.ac.uk/easy_download.html). 

** Fuel poverty data:** A [dataset](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/Encyclopedia/blob/master/England/LSOA/LSOA_EP.csv) of fuel poverty estimates at LSOA level using the LIHC indicator are included in this folder, with estimates from 2013-2018. The image below shows the data from 2018.
