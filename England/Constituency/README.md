## Change over time in fuel poverty in Parliamentary Constituencies

Datasets of fuel poverty estimates at Constitutency level using the LIHC indicator are included in this folder, with estimates from 2013-2018. The image below shows change over time for constitutencies in the North West, but you can find individual csv. files for all Regions. The [code](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/Encyclopedia/blob/master/England/Constituency/ConstituencyChangeOverTime.rmd) to reproduce these heat charts is also included.
